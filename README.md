# Sanctions Update Scraper

A tool designed for the CNAS team to automatically scrape information from Entity List and SDN list updates. Meant to run on MacOS, but can technically be run anywhere. Uses Flask and Python, mostly. 

To use it, just run `setup.sh` in your preferred terminal, and everything should get moving easily. If you have the virtual environment active, you can just do `flask run`. 

`parse_entity_list.py` is just a test file to get the XML working, keeping it here for good luck. Same with `main.py`.
