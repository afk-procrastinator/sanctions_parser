                <P>
                    The Entity List (supplement no. 4 to part 744 of the EAR (15 CFR parts 730-774)) identifies entities for which there is reasonable cause to believe, based on specific and articulable facts, that the entities have been involved, are involved, or pose a significant risk of being or becoming involved in activities contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States, pursuant to § 744.11(b). The EAR impose additional license requirements on, and limit the availability of, most license exceptions for exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) when a listed entity is a party to the transaction. The license review policy for each listed entity is identified in the “License Review Policy” column on the Entity List, and the impact on the availability of license exceptions is described in the relevant 
                    <E T="04">Federal Register</E>
                     document that added the entity to the Entity List. The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) places entities on the Entity List pursuant to part 744 (Control Policy: End-User and End-Use Based) and part 746 (Embargoes and Other Special Controls) of the EAR.
                </P>
                <P>The End-User Review Committee (ERC), composed of representatives of the Departments of Commerce (Chair), State, Defense, Energy and, where appropriate, the Treasury, makes all decisions regarding additions to, removals from, or other modifications to the Entity List. The ERC makes all decisions to add an entry to the Entity List by majority vote and makes all decisions to remove or modify an entry by unanimous vote.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD2">Additions to the Entity List</HD>
                <P>The ERC determined to add AOOK Technology Ltd., under the destination of China; CPUNTO Inc., under the destination of Canada; Dexias Industrial Products and Trade Limited Company, under the destination of Russia; Electronic Network Inc., under the destination of Canada; Innovation and Technologies LLC, under the destination of Russia; and Promtekhkomplekt JSC, under the destination of Russia, to the Entity List. These additions are based on information that these companies significantly contribute to Russia's military and/or defense industrial base and are involved in activities contrary to U.S. national security and foreign policy interests under §§ 744.11 and 744.21 of the EAR. These entities will receive a footnote 3 designation because the ERC has determined that they are Russian or Belarusian `military end users' in accordance with § 744.21. A footnote 3 designation subjects these entities to the Russia/Belarus-Military End User Foreign Direct Product (FDP) rule, detailed under § 734.9(g). These entities are added with a license requirement for all items subject to the EAR. License applications will be reviewed under a policy of denial for all items subject to the EAR, other than applications for food and medicine designated as EAR99, which will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.</P>
                <P>
                    The ERC determined to add Beijing Ti-Tech Science and Technology Development Co., under the destination of China; Beijing Yunze Technology Co., Ltd., under the destination of China; China HEAD Aerospace Technology Co., under the destinations of China, France, and the Netherlands; and Spacety Co., 
                    <PRTPAGE P="12171"/>
                    Ltd., under the destinations of China and Luxembourg, to the Entity List. These additions are based on information that these companies significantly contribute to Russia's military and/or defense industrial base and are involved in activities contrary to U.S. national security and foreign policy interests under §§ 744.11 and 744.21 of the EAR. These entities will receive a footnote 3 designation because the ERC has determined that they are Russian or Belarusian `military end users' in accordance with § 744.21. A footnote 3 designation subjects these entities to the Russia/Belarus-Military End User Foreign Direct Product (FDP) rule, detailed under § 734.9(g). These entities are added with a license requirement for all items subject to the EAR. License applications for these entities will be reviewed under a policy of denial for all items subject to the EAR, other than applications for food and medicine designated as EAR99, which will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.
                </P>
                <P>For the reasons described above, this final rule adds the following 10 entities under 13 entries to the Entity List and includes, where appropriate, aliases:</P>

                <P>BIS notes that this rule is meant to serve as a response to Russian aggression against Ukraine. This rule does include entities in several allied and partnered countries, but is not an action against the countries in which the entities are located or registered or the governments of those countries. This rule only serves as an action against those entities listed, which have assisted the Russian military, contrary to U.S. foreign and national security policy interests.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD2">Savings Clause</HD>
                <P>For the changes being made in this final rule, shipments of items removed from eligibility for a License Exception or export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) without a license (NLR) as a result of this regulatory action that were en route aboard a carrier to a port of export, reexport, or transfer (in-country), on February 24th, pursuant to actual orders for export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) to or within a foreign destination, may proceed to that destination under the previous eligibility for a License Exception or export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) without a license (NLR).</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD1">Export Control Reform Act of 2018</HD>
                <P>On August 13, 2018, the President signed into law the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019, which included the Export Control Reform Act of 2018 (ECRA) (50 U.S.C. 4801-4852). ECRA provides the legal basis for BIS's principal authorities and serves as the authority under which BIS issues this rule.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD1">Rulemaking Requirements</HD>
                <P>1. This rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866.</P>
                <P>
                    2. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no person is required to respond to or be subject to a penalty for failure to comply with a collection of information, subject to the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 
                    <E T="03">et seq.</E>
                    ) (PRA), unless that collection of information displays a currently valid Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Control Number. This regulation involves collections previously approved by OMB under control number 0694-0088, Simplified Network Application Processing System, which includes, among other things, license applications and commodity classifications, and carries a burden estimate of 29.4 minutes for a manual or electronic submission for a total burden estimate of 33,133 hours. Total burden hours associated with the PRA and OMB control number 0694-0088 are not expected to increase as a result of this rule.
                </P>
                <P>3. This rule does not contain policies with federalism implications as that term is defined in Executive Order 13132.</P>
                <P>4. Pursuant to section 1762 of the Export Control Reform Act of 2018, this action is exempt from the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) requirements for notice of proposed rulemaking, opportunity for public participation, and delay in effective date.</P>
                <P>
                    5. Because a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment are not required to be given for this rule by 5 U.S.C. 553, or by any other law, the analytical requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, 
                    <E T="03">et seq.,</E>
                     are not applicable. Accordingly, no regulatory flexibility analysis is required and none has been prepared.
